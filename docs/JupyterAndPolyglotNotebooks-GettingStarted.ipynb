    "# Polyglot Jupyter Notebooks, .NET Interactive, VSCode -- Getting Started\n",
    "Mo easy! We can get going with Jupyter notebooks in VS Code thanks to the Polyglot VS Code extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally people would install some Jupyter / JupyterLab software to then be able to author Jupyter notebooks. There was a bit of \"doing\" to then add support for Jupyter _kernels_ so as to support authoring/running notebook cells in other languages, like .NET-based languages (C#, F#, PowerShell).\n",
    "\n",
    "This became super easy as the .NET Interactive notebooks project eventually became the Polyglot project, leveraging the .NET Interactive engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Polyglot\n",
    "As the name indicates, using a Polyglot notebook enables us to have not only multiple notebooks in various languages supported by the .NET Interactive engine (C#, F#, Javascript, PowerShell, KQL, etc.), but also enables multiple language cells in the _same_ notebook! So, a C# cell, then a PowerShell cell, then one with KQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more -- a single cell within a Polyglot notebook can even have multiple languages itself! So, a single cell with some C# _and_ some PowerShell, thanks to \n",

    "## Get Going\n",
    "The gist:\n",
    "- in any order:\n",
    "    - install .NET SDK\n",
    "    - install VS Code and Polyglot extension\n",
    "- launch VS Code, create new Jupyter notebook, choose .NET Interactive kernel\n",
