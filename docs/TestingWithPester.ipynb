    "- What: we want to be sure that our code provides the expected behavior\n",
    "- How: we write cases that test the given scenarios\n",
    "- Why use framework? Re-use (vs. rewriting our own test framework), along with embracing some other testing (and development) approaches that contribute to consistently higher quality code that meets clearly defined requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining the expected outcome logic as test cases, we can easily and consistently confirm that our code provides the expected results. We can incorporate tests in various points of our developemnt, though it often occurs \"later\". There is an approach that involves writing our tests _first_, then our code: [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (\"TDD\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages have test frameworks for such testing. In PowerShell, the de facto framework is [Pester](https://pester.dev/) (made available as a PowerShell module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pester is a [Behavior-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (\"BDD\") based testing framework. It \"emerged\" from TDD. Often, BDD helps us focus on the \"plain language\" description of the feature / use case, and the testing syntax reflects such things.  For example:\n",
