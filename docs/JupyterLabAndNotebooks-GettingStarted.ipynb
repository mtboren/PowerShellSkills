    "# Getting Started with JupyterLab and .NET Interactive / PowerShell Notebooks\n",
    "Some steps to quickly get going with JupyterLab and making PowerShell notebooks for your MarkDown and code together\n",
    "\n",
    "Contents:\n",
    "- [Overview](#Overview)\n",
    "- Installs\n",
    "- Launch and Create\n",
    "- [Other Thoughts](#Other-Thoughts)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "JupyterLab, from the source:\n",
    "> \"JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data\" -- https://jupyter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "And, Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text\" -- https://jupyter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks can, among other things, show your MarkDown and code in the same doc, run the code live, and store the output as desired in the notebook document itself. Handy for sharing such things. And, places like GitHub will automatically render the notebook and output, so people can instantly see what you meant, without having to have run any code themselves (good for documentation, learning/sharing).  This document, for example, is a Jupyter notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to use such things, you can install the requisite software items (see [Installs](#Installs) below), and then launch your own JupyterLab environment in which to develop. Or, when you're wanting to run you notebooks live on the web, see [Jupyter notebooks live on the web](#Jupyter-notebooks-live-on-the-web) below!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install/Setup\n",
    "Gist:\n",
    "- install Python, .NET Interactive SDK\n",
    "- install `pip` (the package installer for Python)\n",
    "- install the `jupyter` Python module\n",
    "- use `dotnet.exe` to install .NET Interactive Jupyter kernels (the things that enable PowerShell Jupyter notebooks)\n",
    "- launch JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Install\n",
    "That this is about creating [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive#net-interactive-) / PowerShell notebooks, this install section will have Windows-like things in it, but you can use these things anywhere that the .NET Interactive runs. And, for the Python module installs, this is just using default locations. You likely will use a Python `virtualenv` into which to install modules on a shared system, but this is the _quick_ install, so we will leave the `virtualenv` exercise up to you.\n",
    "- Install a modern Python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/, and the current [Microsoft .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (.NET 5 at the time of this writing)\n",
    "- Install `pip` by downloading the `get-pip.py` script and running it, as described in pip's [Installation doc](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (example in PowerShell, here):\n",
    "```PowerShell\n",
    "## download the install script\n",
    "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -OutFile c:\\temp\\get-pip.py\n",
    "## run the install script\n",
    "python c:\\temp\\get-pip.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Install `jupyter` Python module for the current user using `pip` (expects that your `path` is correctly updated to include the folder in which `pip` resides)\n",
    "```PowerShell\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "- install .NET Interactive Jupyter kernels (as described at [Using .NET notebooks on your machine](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/NotebooksLocalExperience.md) from the official dotnet GitHub repo):\n",
    "```PowerShell\n",
    "## list the current Jupyter kernel specs\n",
    "jupyter-kernelspec.exe list\n",
    "## install the .NET Interactive kernel spec\n",
