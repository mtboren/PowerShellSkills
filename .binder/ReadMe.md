# Binder config items
Some configuration items for running things in this repo in Binder Project site at https://mybinder.org/

The configuration gets the Binder environment set with the .NET Interactive Jupyter kernel

These are based on the Binder config files from [Dariel Dato-on](https://github.com/oddrationale) at https://github.com/oddrationale/AdventOfCode2020CSharp

See Binder docs at for Configuration Files at https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/config_files.html
